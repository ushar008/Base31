# Base31
Guys I want ideas to build a mini app on @baseapp.

Right now I’m thinking of launching Fund-Me on Base 
Where people can donate money to others who need it.

Users will be able to create donations on Web3 using @Base and @baseapp.

I want ideas @jessepollak 
what should I build that would actually help people?
